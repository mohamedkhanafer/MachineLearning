# MachineLearning
In this repository, I share a bunch of projects I have completed individually and as part of a team in developping predictive models. These include personnal projects, online competitions, as well as projects done during my studies at IE University.

# 1. Pump it up Competition (DrivenData)
The goal here is to try helping the Tanzanian Ministry of Water to predict the operating condition of a waterpoint accross the country. We want to predict which pumps are going to continue working, which ones are going to need repairs and which ones are going to fail. We are thus dealing here with a multiclass classification problem for which we develop and Ensemble model. 

The link to the competition is the following: https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/7/pump-it-up-data-mining-the-water-table/. 

The model developped ended up in the top 15% out of more than 8900 people listed on the Leaderboard with a score of 0.8129.

The script associated with this model is found in the file 1_Pump_it_up_competition. It contains the following:
#### 1. The datasets
#### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis
#### 3. First drop of features
#### 4. Feature Engineering and Modeling
#### 4.2 Running the First Model (Hyper parameter tunning)
#### 4.3 Feature Creation 
#### 4.4 Trying a lightGBM model (Hyper parameter tunning)
#### 5. Trying an ensemble: the VotingClassifier
#### 6. Conclusion about the main model
#### 7. Extra: A trial with H20's Random Forrest
